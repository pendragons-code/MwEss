## hosting
I actually had some issues with this, so i have basically maxed out free tiers on all of my different cloud providers, and this project is actually too early to start hosting. I advise you all to just clone this repo and host locally if you have your own projects. Better yet, just steal the json files, those datasets are already open for you in here. I will start work on Djx's and Patchika's inf block sheet soon.
